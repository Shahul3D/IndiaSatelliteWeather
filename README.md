## Concept:

###NOTE: App rewrite is currently in progress. This outdated code will be replaced once the new version is ready


`A picture is worth a thousand words`. A complex weather data can be conveyed with a single image map. By observing the Cloud formations around your City, you can easy predict whether the day is going to be Hot or Rainy/Cloudy.

This application fetches the weather data directly from the Official Indian Government webpage for "satellite Images & Products". URL: http://www.imd.gov.in/

It very well equipped with data caching capabilities and will never download any duplicate map data from the server. The downloaded weather maps will stored locally and can be accessed offline.

> NOTE: The code base is outdated. Avoid it from referencing for Development/Architecure/Design related activities. I'm just keeping the app alive since I moved my primary focus into IoT.
